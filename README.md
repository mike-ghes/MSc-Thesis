#### 1 Introduction
  - Needs to be completely rewritten. File hasn't been touched in 4 months. Starting with the intro/conclusion wasn't very helpful.
  
#### 2 Hybrid Set Theory
  - p12: Finish writing up about flow problems
  - p17: Cut. Haven't worked on how folds with different operators interact.

#### 3 Symbolic Linear Algebra
  - p34: Example on evaluating summed matrices.
  - p39: Example on evaluating product of matrices
    - Extend to more blocks
	- Wrap up chapter

#### 4 Integration
  - p41: Introduction.
  - p42: Move this in to Hybrid Set 2? Along with Oriented Intervals.
  - p44: Cut in favour of measuring blocks and oriented Lebesgue. (-3 pages)
  
  
#### (5) Integration II
  - Gone. Merged into Integration

#### 5 Convolution
	- Done.
  
#### 6 Conclusions
  - Again, needs to be completely rewritten.
	
#### (A) Lebesgue Integration
  - Gone. Merged into Integration.
	
#### A Symbolic Convolution with Infinite End-Points
  - Done.
