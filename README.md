#### 1 Introduction
  - https://github.com/mike-ghes/MSc-Thesis/issues/2
  - Needs to be completely rewritten. File hasn't been touched in 4 months. Starting with the intro/conclusion wasn't very helpful.
  
#### 2 Hybrid Set Theory
  - Needs a bit more fluff to blend everything together in the intro.
  - **2.1 Hybrid Sets** https://github.com/mike-ghes/MSc-Thesis/issues/4
    - Examples in 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 are a bit silly but I wanted to get something concrete in.
  - **2.2 Hybrid Relations** https://github.com/mike-ghes/MSc-Thesis/issues/5
    - Another silly example in 2.2.1, just wanted to show a relation.
	- Potentially replace with a graph flow example.
  - **2.3 Hybrid Functions** https://github.com/mike-ghes/MSc-Thesis/issues/6
  - **2.4 Pseudo-functions** https://github.com/mike-ghes/MSc-Thesis/issues/7

#### 3 Symbolic Linear Algebra
  - Introduction needs another paragraph
  - Matrix Addition: example of evaluating at points
  - Matrix Multiplication: many blocks (+example?)
  - Conclusions

#### 4 Integration I
  - https://github.com/mike-ghes/MSc-Thesis/issues/11
  - Mostly happy with the chapter, aside from not really saying anything new.
  - Some of the pages break at weird spots.
  - Riemann integration on the chopping block (replace with Lebesgue)

#### 5 Integration II
  - To finish next.
  - Currently not really related to everything else.
  - Might just stop at Stokes on singular chains and leave integration on manifolds as a remark.

#### 7 Convolution
  - Just about done.
  
#### 8 Conclusions
  - Again, needs to be completely rewritten.
	
#### A Lebesgue Integration
  - Possible replacement for Riemann section.	
	
#### B Symbolic Convolution with Infinite End-Points
  - Prove all 16 cases (separated from 6.3)
