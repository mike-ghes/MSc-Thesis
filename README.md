#### 1 Introduction
  - Needs to be completely rewritten. File hasn't been touched in 4 months. Starting with the intro/conclusion wasn't very helpful.
  
#### 2 Hybrid Set Theory
  - p13: Finish writing up about flow problems

#### 3 Symbolic Linear Algebra
  - p43: 
    - Example on evaluating product of matrices... Uh oh. I guess this doesn't work. o_O
    - Extend to more blocks
	- Wrap up chapter

#### 4 Integration
  - p44: Introduction.
  - p48: Cut Riemann in favour of measuring blocks and oriented Lebesgue? (-3 pages)
  - p58 on: a lot.
  
#### 5 Convolution
  - Done.
  
#### 6 Conclusions
  - Again, needs to be completely rewritten.

#### A Symbolic Convolution with Infinite End-Points
  - Done.
